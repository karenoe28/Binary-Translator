# Binary-Translator

In my first programming class, I fell in love with binary code. I eventually started learning how to translate some numbers and letters into binary.

This simple translator first converts characters into ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), then turns them into binary, and adds spaces between each value.

Itâ€™s a very basic and straightforward piece of code, but I had a lot of fun making it.
